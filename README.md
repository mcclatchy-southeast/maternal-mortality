# Maternal mortality and pregancy-related deaths

A preliminary analysis by The News & Observer appears to show pregnancy-related deaths worsening in North Carolina. Although rates of these deaths increased nationally during the pandemic, the data appears to show North Carolina has seen some of the sharpest rises among states where data is available.

## Pregnancy-related deaths, 2018-2021

Rates of pregnancy-related deaths are calculated for both maternal deaths (during pregnancy to 6 weeks after) and late maternal deaths (6 weeks to a year after pregnancy) using data accessed through the CDC's WONDER tool. Maternal deaths count all deaths with an underlying cause of death using the ICD-10 codes A34, O00-O95 and O98-O99. Late maternal deaths are calculated by subtracting maternal deaths from all deaths with an underlying cause of death listed as A34, O00-O95, O96 or O98-99.

Rates are calculated per 100,000 live births, according to annual final reports from the National Vital Statistics System.

Because the CDC suppresses death totals for some states where the figures are low enough to risk patient privacy, the graphic below shows all states with the full four years of data available from the CDC.

*NOTE: Although CDC does have available data on pregnancy-related deaths prior to 2018, the nationwide analysis here is limited due to variations in how states implemented a pregnancy checkbox, which can alter the underlying cause of death to a pregnancy-related code if the checkbox indicates that the decedent was pregnant within a year of death.*

The CDC notes the following: *Caution should be taken in interpreting these data and comparing states for the following reasons. - For many states, the data are based on small numbers and are, therefore, statistically unreliable. Statistical variability in the maternal mortality rate is determined largely by the number of maternal deaths (i.e., as the number of deaths decreases, the variance, or measure of uncertainty, increases). Rates based on fewer than 20 deaths are suppressed because of reliability and confidentiality. - It is likely that some of the variation in state rates is due to the marked differences in the quality of state maternal mortality data. Variation in the quality of reporting maternal deaths may be due to differences in electronic registration systems and differences in policies and programs designed to verify the pregnancy status of female decedents of reproductive age. These differences may result in underestimates of maternal deaths in some cases, and overestimates in others.*

**NOTE: The results here are PRELIMINARY and are subject to change as additional verification, fact-checking, etc. takes place. If you spot any errors, please contact N&O reporter [Tyler Dukes](mailto:mtdukes@newsobserver.com).**

The N&O analyzed both maternal deaths (during pregnancy to 6 weeks after) and late maternal deaths (6 weeks to a year after pregnancy), according to the N.C. DHHS State Center for Health Statistics death certificate database. Rates are calculated per 100,000 live births sourced from National Vital Statistics System final reports for 2021.

*NOTE: Death certificate data tracks the death of any person in North Carolina, regardless of residency. As such, these figures will differ slightly from the data above from the CDC, which counts deaths based on a person's residence.*

### Pregnancy-related deaths and rural-urban classification, 2018-2021

All pregnancy-related deaths for the years 2018-2021 in North Carolina according to death certificate data, aggregated into rural-urban categories. These categories are based on the [NCHS urban-rural classification scheme for counties](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm#Data_Files_and_Documentation), collpased into three larger groups per the methodology of [Thoma et al.](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/9900/Changes_in_Pregnancy_Related_Mortality_Associated.721.aspx)
